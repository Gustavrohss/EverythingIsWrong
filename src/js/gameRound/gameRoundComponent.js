    <div>
        <p>This div will only be shown when the answers are locked in or time is out!</p>
        <p>At that point, we'll also highlight the correct answer!</p>
        <p>We'll also show what players answered, and how many points they got.</p>
        <p>High Score and Results component might give some inspiration on how to do that.</p>
        <p>We might wanna know more about what shape the data takes before "plugging it in" here</p>
