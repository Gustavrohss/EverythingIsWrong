- L found the high score (via the `High Scores` button).
- L thought someone must have cheated (referring to Fandango who had gotten 3000 points according to the list).
- L navigated to the about page (going back to the home screen with the `Home` button and then using the `About` button).
- L read the information on the about page.
- L didn't really see the point of including the word "prompt" in the text. L asked why "question" where not used instead.

- L moved on to the game session by pushing the `Start game` button.

- L chose an answer.
- L pushed the `Next Question` button.
