# User Feedback

Here we can find files with transcripts from user feedback sessions.

## First Session
In the first session we got feedback on the presentational aspects of the app. 
Some users experienced confusion on the wording on elements. For example "Game link" text when 
joining a lobby was confused with an actual hyperlink instead of code. A notable remark was
that the application did not start at one point.

It was also unclear at times what users would need to do, since they asked what to do at times.

The styling was primitive at this stage, so it was a given that styling could definitely have been improved. 
No direct feedback was given to users when things were loading either. 

## Improvements after first session:
-Styling was added.
-Feedback was added as well with loading screens and error texts.
-Better synchronization.
-Top bar was added to allow free navigation.
-Fixed the issues of "infinite" loading/round not starting.
-Third-party component added.
