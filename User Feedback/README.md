# User Feedback

Here we can find files with transcripts from user feedback sessions.

## First Session
In the first session we got feedback on the presentational aspects of the app. 
Some users experienced confusion on the wording on elements. For example "Game link" text when 
joining a lobby was confused with an actual hyperlink instead of code. A notable remark was
that the application did not start at one point.

It was also unclear at times what users would need to do, since they asked what to do at times.

The styling was primitive at this stage, so it was a given that styling could definitely have been improved. 
No direct feedback was given to users when things were loading either. 

## Specific improvements after first session:
- <b>Styling was added.</b>
- <b>Feedback was added as well with loading screens and error texts.</b>
- <b>Better synchronization.</b>
- <b>Top bar was added to allow free navigation.</b>
- <b>Fixed the issues of "infinite" loading/round not starting.</b>
- <b>Third-party component added.</b>

## Second Session
Positive remarks:
- <b>Styling was appreciated.</b>
- <b>Feedback for users was welcomed. Especially on loading screen, welcoming logged in users and see scores and correct answers during the game.</b>
- <b>Users experienced joy and superiority of performing better than their peers during the game </b>

Constructive feedback on:
- <b>On the phone, the hover function activates on previously clicked elements showing them as "hovered".</b>
- <b>Images during the game session were experienced as too "cropped".</b>
- <b>The ability to choose number of game rounds, in order to adapt to the number of players present</b>
- <b>Host name was difficult to read, due to its color</b>
- <b>Unsure how to get on the highscore list</b>

other remarks: 
- <b>Users are sad that some images do not exist. This is hard to fix due to imgur API not providing this information in the response. Images that do not exist have valid links and only redirect to "does not exist image".

## Specific improvements after second session:
- <b>Hover bug was fixed for mobile phones.</b>
- <b>Images were made larger to remove the cropped experience </b>
- <b>Made the host name color darker to make it more visible </b>
- <b>About page was updated with info regarding the highscore list </b>
